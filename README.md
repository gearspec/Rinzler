Rinzler USB Cleaner V2.0 (30th Dec 2014)
------------------------------------
This is a small tool that removes autorun.inf 
and other malicious scripts, unhides folder 
and files, deletes all shortcut from selected 
drive. Also disables autorun completely.
The tool became necessery when usb flash 
drives were disinfected but the virus or 
malware hidden all the folders, created 
autoruns and made shortcuts to confuse the 
user.Now its possible to get back those files 
with ease.
